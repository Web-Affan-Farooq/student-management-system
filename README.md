### **CSS Grid: A Comprehensive Guide**

---

### **Introduction to CSS Grid**

CSS Grid is a powerful layout system introduced in CSS3 that allows developers to create complex, responsive, and grid-based designs with ease. Itâ€™s a two-dimensional system, meaning it can handle layouts in both rows and columns simultaneously. This makes CSS Grid an essential tool for modern web design.

---

### **Why Use CSS Grid?**

- **Two-Dimensional Layout**: Handles rows and columns effortlessly.
- **Responsive by Design**: Easily adapts to different screen sizes with minimal code.
- **Eliminates Float Issues**: No need for hacks like floats or clearfix.
- **Precise Alignment**: Place and align items anywhere within the grid.

---

### **Key Concepts of CSS Grid**

#### **Grid Container**
A container where the grid layout is applied.

```css
.container {
  display: grid; /* Enables grid layout */
}
```

#### **Grid Items**
The child elements of a grid container. They are automatically arranged into rows and columns.

---

### **Common CSS Grid Properties**

#### **Grid Container Properties**

1. **`display: grid`**  
   Defines the container as a grid.

2. **`grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows`**  
   Specifies the size and number of rows and columns.

   ```css
   .container {
     display: grid;
     grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
     grid-template-rows: 100px auto;
   }
   ```

3. **`gap`**  
   Adds spacing between grid rows and columns.

   ```css
   .container {
     gap: 10px;
   }
   ```

4. **`grid-auto-rows` and `grid-auto-columns`**  
   Defines the default size of rows or columns added implicitly.

   ```css
   .container {
     grid-auto-rows: 150px;
   }
   ```

5. **`justify-items` and `align-items`**  
   Aligns grid items horizontally and vertically within their cells.

   ```css
   .container {
     justify-items: center;
     align-items: center;
   }
   ```

---

#### **Grid Item Properties**

1. **`grid-column` and `grid-row`**  
   Specifies the start and end positions for a grid item.

   ```css
   .item {
     grid-column: 1 / 3; /* Spans from column 1 to 3 */
     grid-row: 2 / 4; /* Spans from row 2 to 4 */
   }
   ```

2. **`justify-self` and `align-self`**  
   Aligns a specific grid item horizontally or vertically.

   ```css
   .item {
     justify-self: start;
     align-self: end;
   }
   ```

---

### **Examples of CSS Grid**

#### **1. Basic Grid Layout**

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="item">1</div>
  <div class="item">2</div>
  <div class="item">3</div>
</div>

<style>
  .container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); /* 3 equal columns */
    gap: 10px;
  }
  .item {
    background: lightblue;
    padding: 20px;
    text-align: center;
  }
</style>
```

---

<div class="container">
  <div class="item">1</div>
  <div class="item">2</div>

  }
  .item {
    background: lightcoral;
    padding: 20px;
    text-align: center;
  }
</style>
```
